A graph is simply a set of values that are related in a pairwise fashion. Connections between different nodes.
- Each item is called a node or a vertex.
- Nodes are connected with edges.

Graphs ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect to other things.
- Facebook uses it for their social network
- Amazon uses it for their recommendation engines
- Google Maps uses graphs for determining the shortest path

Graphs compass things that we've used before, such as trees and linked lists.
Linked lists are a type of tree and tree is a type of graph.


-Directed (Twitter)
-Undirected (Facebook)
-Weighted
-Unweighted

-This sort of graphs(weighted-unweighted) are used a lot in calculating optimal paths.
    -Google Maps would use a weighted graph to decide what is the shortest path for you get there.

-Cyclic
-Acyclic

- When you have vertices connected in a circular fashion, it's called a cyclic. You can start and back to that original
node versus acyclic you can't do that.

Pros:
-Relationships

Cons:
-Scaling is hard
