/*

They are both what we call linear data structures.
Linear data structures allow us to traverse. That is,
go through data elements sequentially one by one.
They can be implemented in similar ways.
The main difference is only how items get removed from this data
structure.

Unlike an array, In stacks and Qs, there's no random access operation.
You mainly use stacks and Qs to run commands like push, pop etc.


Stacks and queues are great for some fast operations, fast peek, ordered but slow lookup.
