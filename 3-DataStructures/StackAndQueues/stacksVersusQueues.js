For example, If we want to go to a new website, let's say
we go to Twitter. But then we decided, I wanna go back. We
remove Twitter press back button and we get to Youtube.

We can build it with:
-Arrays
-Linked Lists



->One major thing is that arrays allow something called
cache locality, which makes them technically faster when accessing
its items in memory because they're right next to each other versus
a linked list that has them scattered all over memory and also link
lists have extra memory associated with them because we have to hold on to
those pointers. But on the other hand, they have more dynamic memory.

-Arrays
-Linked Lists

-> You would never want to build it with an array. An ideally you want to
implement them with linked lists. Arrays have indexes associated with them.
If we want to remove the first item, we need to shift the indexes over. On the
other hand, we have linked lists where we have is a pointer to the head and
then perhaps we have a pointer to the tail. All we need is to change the head.
